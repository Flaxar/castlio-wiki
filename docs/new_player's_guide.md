# New player tutorial
* Welcome in castlio, multiplayer survival game
* In this tutorial, you will find how to mine blocks, craft items and build a house
* Even then, there is so much more to do, read [experts_guide.md]() next.

## Gather phase
* When starting your castl.io world you and other player are placed on random 
positions around the map
* Everyone is spawned beside 1 workbench, which is essential block for crafting
* First you need to find some sticks and stones, so go and explore. Do not go 
too far, and if you see an enemy, run as fast as you can. You should not find 
other players in this stage, but if you do make friends not enemies. 
* You will need in total **2 sticks and 5 stone**, but there is a catch. In your 
inventory you can have a maximum of 5 items, so you need to make multiple trips. 
When you are scouting, you can also search for food, the most common food are 
berries (berries.png) and fruit trees (fruit trees.png). For now, you can only 
pick up berries. Food bar is right up on the screen at all times, do not forget 
to eat berries regurarly. Drop sticks and stones on ground next to your workbench. 

## Crafting phase
* Now you know your surroundings and have some basic items collected.
* Use 1 stick and 2 stone to craft an axe. As long as you have axe selected, 
you can cut trees.
* Use 1 stick and 3 stone to craft a pickaxe. You can use it to destroy rocks.
* You can now go and gather resources and build yourself a small settlement, 
most probably around your workbench. You can craft an chest using 2 wood 
(1 wood = 2 sticks).
* Beware in this phase, there is possibility of enemies. You can craft a sword, 
to be ready to strike back. 
* Sword is made using 5 iron and one stick. Iron is a rare rock easily 
distinguished from other because it has large cros in the middle.
* If you do not have iron nearby, you can craft magic weapons using rare 
materials. Rare materials are those gem like items mostly found in caves 
or deserts.
* If you can't affort neither, use your speaking skills.

## Building phase
* Now you are ready to build yourself a proper home
* You can choose building material, wood or stone.
* One block is made of 4 building materials.
* You can make 3 basic types of blocks
  * Wall = 4 materials (stone/wood)
  * Door = wall + 1 (stick/stone)
  * Window = wall + 2 (stick/stone)
* Make yourself a small shelter, to protect yourself when crafting and protect
your belongings
* Beware, once you place a block, it takes a while to destroy it. And 
destruction is permanent.  
* You should now go in the world, and recruit others. You can't trust your 
friends, but you need them for the final phase of your castlio beginners journey.

## Conquer phase
* This is perhaps the hardest and most fun part in castlio.
* You have now a small castle and at least one other loayal player
* You made yourself an armor and proper weapons
* Talk to your friend in private and scout the map for enemy castles
* Strike them when they least expect you.
* In castl.io, you win if you had fun. And what's more fun than burning down enemy castle. 
> DEVELOPER SIDE NOTE: burning down enemy castles is not implemented yet, 
> but be sure to check castl.io wiki and game to keep yourself updated.
