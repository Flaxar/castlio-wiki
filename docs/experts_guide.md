# Expert's Guide
In this guide we will look at weapons, armor and enemy mobs.
In castlio there are three types of weapons.

* **Short range** - swords, hammers, battle axes and close combat weapons
* **Long range** - bows and crossbows you'll find here.
* **Magic weapons** - staffs, wands and rods and anything mana related

Good weapon is also a group of warriors, for example to kill a knight in
chestplate you'll need two mages or two gem sword holders.

## Honorable uncraftable mentions
You will not find crafting recipe for these items and blocks:

* Bombs - destroys block much much faster
* Tombstone - when player dies, tombstone is created
* Food - steaks, apples and other consumable items
