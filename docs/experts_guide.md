# Expert's Guide

## Weapons
In castlio there are three types of weapons.

* **Short range** - swords, hammers, battle axes and close combat weapons
* **Long range** - bows and crossbows you'll find here.
* **Magic weapons** - staffs, wands and rods and anything mana related

Good weapon is also a group of warriors, for example to kill a knight in
chestplate you'll need two mages or two gem sword holders.

## Mana and water bars
Mana and water bars are located under your health and hunger bar. First decreses
water bar and if it is empty, then mana bar decreses. Mana bar is useful for
magic weapons. Each magic wand has is a different deadly weapon. Each of these
wands take different amount of mana to operate. If your mana is too low, you
can not use your magic weapons. To increase water bar, one must eat fruits,
eggs and vegetables.

## Loot
When you kill a [mob](mobs.md) you recieve loot as a reward. Loot from mobs
is always the same and is decribed in mobs table. This is contrast to
chest loot which is assigned at the start of the game randomly. The mechanism
that assignes loot to chests is quite simple. All chests have theoretical rarity
value, which is 16. When filling a chest, chest choses random rarity and random
item of that rarity. If chest can hold that item, it is put in there and another
item is selected. This cycle continues until chest is full or it can not hold
item of selected quality. In normal chests generate items of rarity 1 to 4 and
in locked chests 5 to 8.

| Rarity | Items
| ------ | -----
| 1 | Stick, wood, stone    
| 2 | Leather, metal, string
| 3 | Coin, gem, consumable
| 4 | Key, hat, belt
| 5 | Weapon
| 6 | Armor
| 7 | Magic weapon
| 8 | Shiny gem, bomb

## Honorable uncraftable mentions

* Bombs - destroys block much much faster
* Tombstone - when player dies, tombstone is created
* Food - steaks, apples and other consumable items
