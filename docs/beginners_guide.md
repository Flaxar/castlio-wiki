# Beginner's Guide
* Welcome in castlio, multiplayer survival game
* In this tutorial, you will find how to mine blocks, craft items and build a house
* Even then, there is so much more to do, read [experts_guide.md]() next.

## Gather phase
* When starting your castl.io world, you and other players are placed on random
positions around the map.
* Everyone is spawned beside workbench, which is essential block for crafting.
* Before you can craft tools, you need to find some items, so go and explore
your surroundings. You should not find other players in this stage, but if you
do, make friends not enemies.
* For start, go and find **2 sticks and 5 stone**. In your inventory, you can
have a maximum of 5 items, so you need to make multiple trips. Put your items
next to your workbench, ready for next phase.
* When scouting, you can also search for food, the most common food are berries
(berries.png) and fruit trees (fruit trees.png). Those yellow hearts is your
 **food** bar, it gradually decreases. You can eat berries using 'E' key.
* When your food bar is empty, you will lose your **health** (red hearts). To replenish
health, you need to have your food bar on maximum or you can craft potion of
healing (two berries = one potion).
* Do not worry about the water and mana bar.

## Crafting phase
* Now you know your surroundings and have some basic items collected.
* Use 1 stick and 2 stone to craft an **axe**. As long as you have axe selected,
you can cut trees for more sticks.
* Use 1 stick and 3 stone to craft a **pickaxe**. You can use it to destroy rocks
for more stone.
* You can now go and gather those resources and build yourself a small settlement.
See [blocks](blocks.md)
* Beware in this phase, there is possibility of enemies. You can craft a sword,
to be ready to strike back.
* Sword is made using 5 iron and one stick. Iron is a rare rock easily
distinguished from other because it has large cros in the middle.
* If you do not have iron nearby, you can craft magic weapons using rare
materials. Rare materials are those gem like items mostly found in caves
or deserts.
* If you can't affort neither, use your speaking skills.

## Building phase
* Now you are ready to build yourself a proper home
* You can choose building material, wood or stone.
* One block is made of 4 building materials.
* You can make 3 basic types of blocks
  * Wall = 4 materials (stone/wood)
  * Door = wall + 1 (stick/stone)
  * Window = wall + 2 (stick/stone)
* Make yourself a small shelter, to protect yourself when crafting and protect
your belongings
* Beware, once you place a block, it takes a while to destroy it. And
destruction is permanent.  
* You should now go in the world, and recruit others. You can't trust your
friends, but you need them for the final phase of your castlio beginners journey.

## Conquer phase
* This is perhaps the hardest and most fun part in castlio.
* You have now a small castle and at least one other loayal player
* You made yourself an armor and proper weapons
* Talk to your friend in private and scout the map for enemy castles
* Strike them when they least expect you.
* In castl.io, you win if you had fun. And what's more fun than burning down enemy castle.
> DEVELOPER SIDE NOTE: burning down enemy castles is not implemented yet,
> but be sure to check castl.io wiki and game to keep yourself updated.
