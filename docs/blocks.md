## Storage blocks
Locked chest info: You will need a key to open locked chest. Using that key will
bind the key to the chest, chest will open only using that key. One key can be
used to bind multiple locked chests, but locked chest has only one binding key.
Locked chests and doors generated by sever can be unlocked by any key,
but once they are, key is assigned to them. Do not lose your keys.
