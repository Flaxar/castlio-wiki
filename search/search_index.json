Gather phase When starting your castl.io world, you and other players are placed on random positions around the map. Everyone is spawned beside workbench, which is essential block for crafting. Before you can craft tools, you need to find some items, so go and explore your surroundings. You should not find other players in this stage, but if you do, make friends not enemies. For start, go and find 2 sticks and 5 stone . In your inventory, you can have a maximum of 5 items, so you need to make multiple trips. Put your items next to your workbench, ready for next phase. When scouting, you can also search for food, the most common food are berries (berries.png) and fruit trees (fruit trees.png). Those yellow hearts is your food bar, it gradually decreases. You can eat berries using 'E' key. When your food bar is empty, you will lose your health (red hearts). To replenish health, you need to have your food bar on maximum or you can craft potion of healing (two berries = one potion). Do not worry about the water and mana bar. Crafting phase Now you know your surroundings and have some basic items collected. Use 1 stick and 2 stone to craft an axe . As long as you have axe selected, you can cut trees for more sticks. Use 1 stick and 3 stone to craft a pickaxe . You can use it to destroy rocks for more stone. You can now go and gather those resources and build yourself a small settlement. See blocks Beware in this phase, there is possibility of enemies. You can craft a sword, to be ready to strike back. Sword is made using 5 iron and one stick. Iron is a rare rock easily distinguished from other because it has large cros in the middle. If you do not have iron nearby, you can craft magic weapons using rare materials. Rare materials are those gem like items mostly found in caves or deserts. If you can't affort neither, use your speaking skills. Building phase Now you are ready to build yourself a proper home You can choose building material, wood or stone. One block is made of 4 building materials. You can make 3 basic types of blocks Wall = 4 materials (stone/wood) Door = wall + 1 (stick/stone) Window = wall + 2 (stick/stone) Make yourself a small shelter, to protect yourself when crafting and protect your belongings Beware, once you place a block, it takes a while to destroy it. And destruction is permanent. You should now go in the world, and recruit others. You can't trust your friends, but you need them for the final phase of your castlio beginners journey. Conquer phase This is perhaps the hardest and most fun part in castlio. You have now a small castle and at least one other loayal player You made yourself an armor and proper weapons Talk to your friend in private and scout the map for enemy castles Strike them when they least expect you. In castl.io, you win if you had fun. And what's more fun than burning down enemy castle. DEVELOPER SIDE NOTE: burning down enemy castles is not implemented yet, but be sure to check castl.io wiki and game to keep yourself updated.","title":"Beginner's Guide"},{"location":"beginners_guide/#beginners-guide","text":"Welcome in castlio, multiplayer survival game In this tutorial, you will find how to mine blocks, craft items and build a house Even then, there is so much more to do, read experts_guide.md next.","title":"Beginner's Guide"},{"location":"beginners_guide/#gather-phase","text":"When starting your castl.io world, you and other players are placed on random positions around the map.

Short range - swords, hammers, battle axes and close combat weapons Long range - bows and crossbows you'll find here. Magic weapons - staffs, wands and rods and anything mana related Good weapon is also a group of warriors, for example to kill a knight in chestplate you'll need two mages or two gem sword holders. Mana and water bars Mana and water bars are located under your health and hunger bar. First decreses water bar and if it is empty, then mana bar decreses. Mana bar is useful for magic weapons. Each magic wand has is a different deadly weapon. Each of these wands take different amount of mana to operate. If your mana is too low, you can not use your magic weapons. To increase water bar, one must eat fruits, eggs and vegetables. Loot When you kill a mob you recieve loot as a reward. Loot from mobs is always the same and is decribed in mobs table. This is contrast to chest loot which is assigned at the start of the game randomly. The mechanism that assignes loot to chests is quite simple. All chests have theoretical rarity value, which is 16. When filling a chest, chest choses random rarity and random item of that rarity. If chest can hold that item, it is put in there and another item is selected. This cycle continues until chest is full or it can not hold item of selected quality. In normal chests generate items of rarity 1 to 4 and in locked chests 5 to 8.
